## üìå Description

This game allows the player to control a yellow snake that moves across the screen to collect food and grow longer. The aim is to score as high as possible without hitting the wall or the snake's own body. If the snake collides with either, the game ends.

Each time the game starts, the snake appears at a random position. The player uses number keys to move the snake in four directions (up, down, left, right). The interface includes a menu screen with instructions, a score display, current level, and maze layout.
